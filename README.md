## üìñ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to address the following research question:

> *How does the distribution of images across different classes in the Fashion-MNIST dataset affect the performance of Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms?*

We implemented, trained, and evaluated both models from scratch to compare their effectiveness in a real-world image classification task.

## üíæ The Dataset

We used the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, a popular "drop-in replacement" for the original MNIST dataset, which is more complex and provides a better benchmark for modern ML algorithms.

  <em>A sample of images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset, illustrating the 10 distinct classes.</em>
</p>

* **Contents:** 70,000 grayscale images (60k training, 10k test)
* **Image Size:** $28 \times 28$ pixels
* **Classes:** 10 categories of fashion products

## ü§ñ Models & Methodology

We implemented two distinct models to compare a classical machine learning approach with a deep learning approach.

1.  **Random Forest (RF):** An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees. We used this to see how a strong, non-neural-network model would perform on raw pixel data.
    * *Implementation:* `scikit-learn`

2.  **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A deep learning architecture specifically designed for computer vision. CNNs are built to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from images.
    * *Implementation:* `TensorFlow` and `Keras`

## üìä Results: RF vs. CNN

Our analysis showed a clear performance difference. The CNN, which is designed for spatial data like images, significantly outperformed the Random Forest model.

### Performance Comparison

| Model | Final Accuracy | Key Observation |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Random Forest** | ~82% | Struggled to distinguish between similar classes (e.g., "Shirt" vs. "T-shirt/top"). |
| **CNN** | **~92%** | Effectively learned image features, leading to high accuracy and better generalization. |

### Visualizing Model Performance

Here is a direct visual comparison of the models' predictions and their confusion matrices.

| Random Forest | Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) |

| **Prediction Plot (16 Images)** | **Prediction Plot (16 Images)** |

| *The RF model making several errors (in red) on similar items like "shirt" and "top".* | *CNN model plot will show fewer errors.* |
| **Confusion Matrix** | **Normalized Confusion Matrix** |
| ![RF Confusion Matrix](images/RF-Error-Matrix.png) | **(Placeholder)** <br> *[Add CNN confusion matrix here]* |
| *The RF matrix shows significant confusion between classes 0, 2, 4, and 6 (T-shirt, Pullover, Coat, Shirt).* | *CNN matrix will show a cleaner diagonal line.* |
